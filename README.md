# Face Liveness Detection Project

## Overview

This project implements a Face Liveness Detection system designed to prevent spoofing during Aadhaar authentication. The system uses a combination of techniques to distinguish between real faces and fake representations, enhancing security in biometric verification processes.

## Features

- **Real-Time Detection**: The model is capable of detecting liveness in real-time during authentication processes.
- **Robustness**: The system is designed to handle various types of spoofing attacks, including printed photos, 3D masks, and video playback.
- **Easy Integration**: The solution can be easily integrated into existing authentication systems.
- **High Accuracy**: The model has been trained on a comprehensive dataset, ensuring high detection accuracy.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Frameworks**: OpenCV, TensorFlow, or PyTorch (depending on your implementation)
- **Frontend**: React (if applicable)
- **Dataset**: iBeta Level 1 dataset, consisting of various spoofing attacks.
- **Intel oneAPI**: Utilized for optimizing the performance of the detection algorithms.
